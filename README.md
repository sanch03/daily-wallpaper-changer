# State of the Project

Browser extension that sets a daily image background to popular websites.

Currently the codebase is 3 years old and unmaintained.

I am now working on rewriting the entire extension and also making it manifest v3 compliant.

* [ ] Figure out if it is even possible to have an extension like this work with manifest v3
* [ ] Rewrite css injection system
* [ ] Fix known bugs with currently supported websites
* [ ] Add a scalable way to add more websites and implement bugfixes
* [ ] Publish updated extension to major web stores



##### Current Website Support

* Google Home Page [Partially Working]
* Google Search Results Page [Broken]
* Wikipedia [Working]


##### Future Plans

* Custom gradients instead of backgrounds
* Options to pick image categories
* More websites -> Reddit, Gmail, Outlook etc
